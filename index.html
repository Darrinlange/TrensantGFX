		<h1>Welcome to TGW - the Trensant Graphics Wrapper library</h1>
		<p>The Trensant Graphics Library is a wrapper of several 3rd party graphics and charting libraries which are useful for visualizing data using different techniques.  See the <a href="./README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> file in the distribution for more on which libraries and charts are wrapped and how to use them.</p>

		<br>
	
		<h2>Why a chart wrapper?</h2>
		This wrapper library supplies only a few charts natively but "wraps" numerous charts from many other popular libraries in to a common API and with simplified loading.  This allows a programmer whose first langauge may not be javacsript and HTML to quickly use some of the charts here in a web page.  For example for programmers used to Python, R or even C++ just drop your JSON data in a local folder, include a path to libs folder and then a minimal HTML page can be used to render some charts and graphics. In addition if you're just trying to get some charts running quickly this library can save much time since it handles a lot of "boiler plate code" and allows comparisons of different libaries charts using this wrappers common API.<br>

		Not every chart in each library is wrapped and in many cases "simplified" deciscions were made to get the chart to render with a minimal API.  While this may not be optimal its easy to go the wrapper code and copy out native access to particular libary and chart and use that as base.  

		<h2>Gallery and Examples</h2>
		<a href="./examples/gallery.html" target="_blank">Gallery of all working charts.</a>&nbsp; This gallery works offline if the repo is cloned.  Also each chart, if clicked on supplies a live interactive code editor to play with the chart which also works offline if the repo is cloned. <br><br>
		<a href="./all-charts.html" target="_blank">All Charts on a Single Page</a>.&nbsp; This page shows all the charts loaded together (note this can take a moment) along with their data.
		<br>
		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		See the README.md and examples directory for more on how to invoke specific charts.<br><br>
