# Libraries for Graphics and Charts

This directory contains libraries for which the tgfx wrapper has been tested.  They are copied here since as time progresses the CDN versions of these libs may change in their content and API.  Atleast these will be tested and known to work with all provided examples.

As of this writing some chart libraries, such as Google charts, aren't provided as open source javascript libraries.  As a result there is no version of those here.
